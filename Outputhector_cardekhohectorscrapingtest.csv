MG HECTOR,My Road Trip experience with MG Hector.,5,"I had planned a road trip with some of my friends last week. I have an MG Hector Sharp Hybrid 1.5. Drove the car from Raipur to Jagdalpur without stopping anywhere, that's approximately 300Kms. The mileage was 13.5 kmpl. We stopped for an hour and continued our trip to Danteshwari, then to Chitrakoot waterfalls, then back to Jagdalpur, then we returned to Raipur. This was all within 36 hours. The car nearly had a continuous run. There were all types of terrains enough from single lane steep hilly terrain to no roads at all in the Bastar region, roads filled with potholes were also on our list, and the car handled everything pretty well. At the end of the trip, the car travelled over 1200Kms and to my surprise, the engine temperature was optimal all the way even after rash driving on a long stretch of roads(State Highway), speeds exceeding 150Kmph, the overall mileage at the end of the trip was 12.6KmpL. This car performed well beyond my expectations. As I even drove it over 350kms on a single stretch and still faced no problems, no fatigue. Quite refined engine there MG.",By Supratik Upadhyay,"On: Dec 23, 2019 | 4513 Views",www.cardekho.com

MG HECTOR,MG hector is The Best Car,5,"When we first experienced the Hector on the hills of Coimbatore, we knew it had the makings of a winner. No doubt, the distinctive design, exhaustive features list and a hugely spacious cabin are all strong factors in the success of an SUV, but that brief drive was just a sampler and didn't include the petrol-automatic variant. This variant is the pick of the lot, accounting for over 50 percent sales, and has a waiting period that can stretch to seven months. Hence, in this very exacting road test. The other big talking point is the connectivity you get from a dedicated SIM card that's embedded in the infotainment system. This allows your phone to communicate with MG's iSMART app, which gives you control of a host of functions remotely. The app, available on both Apple and Android platforms, lets you set driver alerts, check the overall health of the car, and find your car in a parking spot by flashing the headlights and activating the horn. If you've parked far off, the app will also guide you to your spot by mapping the route. Then there is the geofencing functionality, which means you can set a perimeter (of up to 100km) for your Hector, and should it go beyond that, it would send you alerts on your smartphone. It also tells you the driving style, speed, and alerts medical services and preset contacts in the unfortunate event of an accident where airbags have been deployed.",By Md Yasin,"On: Dec 18, 2019 | 337 Views",www.cardekho.com

If tacking about the features it is fully loaded with features such as massive 10 inch touch screen through which every function of car is controlled, its an internet-connected car, also the book closes automatically by pressing just 1 button, reverse parking camera is also included with sensors, the additional touch to the car is its massive panoramic sunroof which lets the interior to be brighter and feels more luxurious. Taking of space then Hector has humongous space which includes, the legroom, the headroom, shoulder room, etc. All feel large even the boot of hector is big enough. Coming to the engine on paper as seen it gives 179 bhp but due to some reasons, it doesn't feel that way. Also, the steering is not like an SUV kind and the all-touch functionality which is provided is somewhere inconvenient while driving physical buttons are handier than that.",By Akshat Sharma,"On: Dec 04, 2019 | 2027 Views",www.cardekho.com
MG HECTOR,Awesome car.,5,What a smooth and powerful car. Great looks and fuel-efficient. Value for money and highly recommended.,By Ammar Chichi,"On: Dec 03, 2019 | 55 Views",www.cardekho.com
MG HECTOR,Petrol variant is less powerful.,4,"Purchased petrol hybrid variant on Aug-19 and Completed 5,500Kms. There is nothing more I can add to its good points, mostly all were covered in other reviews. I would like to advise from my experience for Petrol variant that it does not have sufficient power for faster pickup and sporty drive. You should treat this beast gently to get better mileage. The worst city mileage I got was 8Km/L in the city and the best was 18Km/L on the highway with A.C.-Off and speed below 80Km/H.",By Pn Chandrasekhar,"On: Dec 04, 2019 | 816 Views",www.cardekho.com

MG HECTOR,Great build quality and spacious.,3,"As I shut the door of the Hector, the door's thud surprised me. It is a solid car. The acceleration was decent and the power delivery is great. The space in the back seat is amazing. The quality is top-notch as you expect from a 20+ lac car. The thing that annoyed me is the screen, it's laggy. The basic functions like the A.C. and the 360 camera seem to bother you to use. It's irritating in the long run. The virtual assistant works when it hears you and understands you. Everything is fine, but the infotainment feels like a beta and should be updated soon for a smoother experience. The worst part is, you don't have physical controls for the A.C.",By Shrivats Poddar,"On: Dec 05, 2019 | 567 Views",www.cardekho.com

MG HECTOR,Amazing machine.,2,"People say that the electronics won't work out in India but MG has proved almost everyone wrong. Speaking of electronics, the car is fully loaded with advanced technology and none of them feels like it's overdone. My second point is the mileage, Hector is an SUV but still offers great mileage of around 16kmpl. The dimensions of the car are humungous. In terms of comfort, the car can beat any of its rivals and is also prepared to compete with upper-class SUVs like Fortuner, Endeavour, etc. I recently went on a road trip in my hector and the ride quality was amazing, the suspensions were pretty soft providing a clean ride. Though the car is pretty huge, it is easily drivable in the city without any problem. I've heard it is also called the internet car due to the presence of a massive touch screen system with a pretty clear voice assistant. It manages to recognize the Indian accent as well.

It gives superior comfort for drivers/passengers. HiTech features make you feel like you are in full control of the car. No complaints in this section. Overall I am very happy. After driving it on different roads in city & highways, I don't feel the acceleration is leaner enough in all gears. Overall I felt it is ""sluggish"" / ""underpowered."" The fuel efficiency is not up to the figures declared by MG India (i.e. 15.8 kmpl). I only got 9 to 10 kmpl in city & 11 to 13kmpl in Highways.

The safety features of this car are very good, 6 airbags, Abs, EBD, TC, Hill hold etc. The design of this car is awesome and the comfort is very good. The rear passenger gets a rear armrest, rear Ac vents and a good amount of space. The main attraction of this car is the internet Inside 10.4-inch huge touch screen. It's really awesome. The sound quality is also great. Pros:- 1. Value for money 2.

MG HECTOR,It is a very cool car,5,"The length and wheelbase are the largest amongst its rivals, though the narrow girth and excessive rear overhang do throw proportions off a bit. The 17-inch wheels also look a size too small. Generous use of chrome means the Hector is big on bling and elements like the split LED DRLs and headlamps set up ensure the MG grabs attention. The MG's cabin is simply cavernous and there is plenty of space for five passengers and their luggage. Range-topping versions get a massive panoramic sunroof that only adds to the airy feel in the interior. There are lots of other goodies onboard and the features really are a draw in their own right. The much talked about a 10.4-inch touchscreen that comes armed with connectivity tech is the focal point on the dashboard. Material quality is largely good but you will find some less special bits in the interior as well. The MG Hector Diesel is 170 HP, 2.0-liter engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, packs enough grunt and impresses with its linear power delivery and refinement. A snappy clutch remains a pain point of the Fiat-sourced engine though. The MG Hector Petrol gets a 143 HP, 1.5-liter turbocharged unit with a 6-speed manual as standard and a 48 V mild-hybrid setup as an option. The petrol hybrid is easy-going but lacks oomph for quick overtakes. The dual-clutch transmission does add convenience to the package but it's not the slickest of gearboxes. The ride quality is fairly good at town speeds, but up the pace, and you'll get a fair bit of body movement on undulating surfaces. The MG doesn't feel as well tied down as rivals at triple-digit speeds either and the noticeable body roll also means it simply isn't a driver's car. The steering isn't the most fearsome but it is light at low speeds and makes it easy to maneuver the large SUV.",By Brij Bhushan Katoch,"On: Nov 20, 2019 | 749 Views",www.cardekho.com
MG HECTOR,Performance and looks are great but not good in mileage,4,"Beautiful car with great performance. Looks are great with a very huge cabin space like other cars.
